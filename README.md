## What is H/F?

Hackers/Founders [H/F] is the world's largest technology community, with more than 300,000 members in more than 142 cities in 49 countries around the world. Made up of entrepreneurs, H/F accommodates programmers, technology developers, entrepreneurs and all those technology lovers who are looking to start a project and don't know where to start.

**We are a community where everyone can feel welcome.**

## H/F culture

Hackers/Founders was started by founders for founders and we take our culture very seriously. We tend to be very nerdy and collaborative, and we really like to learn and freely share ideas. In fact, H/F is open source, so we have had to adopt some guidelines for behavior.

The following are **the Four Rules of Hackers/Founders**:

- Rule 1: *Don't be a jerk.*

  It means that you must maintain your image for your good and that of the community, the idea is to highlight your presence in a positive way, treat your peers well, be part of the solution and not the problem.

- Rule 2: *Do the right thing for your community.*

  Make proposals, collaborate so that the community is bigger and stronger.

- Regla 3: *If you use the H/F brand, PLEASE don't mess it up.*

  If you use the name of the community, do it well, give it strength, keep your word and be ethical, otherwise don't use it.

- Regla 4: *Tell us what you community needs.*

  There are no bad ideas, there are bad executions. If you think you can help to improve something, say so and do it. Be part of the solution, don't just criticize.

## Our focus
